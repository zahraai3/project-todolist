# 📋 To-Do List App

A simple interactive **To-Do List** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project is based on a tutorial but customized with my own ideas and extra features.

## ✅ What does this app do?

- Add new tasks to your list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Save tasks in **Local Storage** so they stay even after refreshing the page.
- Add tasks to a separate **Important Tasks** list.
- Responsive layout with gradient background.
- *(Optional)* A Dark Mode toggle (if added).

---

## 🚀 How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Write your task in the input field.
3. Click **Add** to add the task to the main list.
4. Click the ⭐ button to add the task to the **Important Tasks** list.
5. Click on a task to mark it as completed.
6. Click the `×` icon to remove a task.

## 💡 Future ideas

- Add a **Dark Mode** toggle to switch themes.
- Improve the UI with more animations.
- Connect to a backend to store tasks in a real database.

- Just a modern web browser. No extra libraries or frameworks needed.
